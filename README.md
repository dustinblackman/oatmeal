## Overview

Oatmeal is a terminal UI chat application that speaks with LLMs, complete with slash commands and fancy chat bubbles. It features agnostic backends to allow switching between the powerhouse of ChatGPT, or keeping things private with Ollama.
While Oatmeal works great as a stand alone terminal application, it works even better paired with an editor like Neovim!

See it in action with Neovim (click to restart):

_Note:_ This project is still quite new, and LLM's can return unexpected answers the UI isn't prepped for. There's likely a few bugs hidden somewhere.

## Usage

Oatmeal allows customizing configuration either through command line parameters, or more permanently with environment
variables. By default, Ollama is the selected backend, `llama2:latest` as the default model, and the `clipboard` integration for an editor.
See `oatmeal --help`, `/help` in chat, or the output below to get all the details.

CHAT COMMANDS:
  - /modellist (/ml) - Lists all available models from the backend.
  - /model (/model) [MODEL_NAME,MODEL_INDEX] - Sets the specified model as the active model. You can pass either the model name, or the index from `/modellist`.
  - /append (/a) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] - Appends code blocks to an editor. See Code Actions for more details.
  - /replace (/r) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] - Replaces selections with code blocks in an editor. See Code Actions for more details.
  - /copy (/c) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] - Copies the entire chat history to your clipboard. When a `CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER` is used, only the specified copy blocks are copied to clipboard. See Code Actions for more details.
  - /quit /exit (/q) - Exit Oatmeal.
  - /help (/h) - Provides this help menu.

CHAT HOTKEYS:
  - Up arrow - Scroll up.
  - Down arrow - Scroll down.
  - CTRL+U - Page up.
  - CTRL+D - Page down.
  - CTRL+C - Interrupt waiting for prompt response if in progress, otherwise exit.
  - CTRL+R - Resubmit your last message to the backend.

CHAT CODE ACTIONS:
When working with models that provide code, and using an editor integration, Oatmeal has the capabilities to read selected code from an editor, and submit model provided code back in to an editor. Each code block provided by a model is indexed with a (NUMBER) at the beginning of the block to make it easily identifiable.

  - /append (/a) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] will append one-to-many model provided code blocks to the open file in your editor.
  - /replace (/r) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] - will replace selected code in your editor with one-to-many model provided code blocks.
  - /copy (/c) [CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER?] - Copies the entire chat history to your clipboard. When a `CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER` is used it will append one-to-many model provided code blocks to your clipboard, no matter the editor integration.

The `CODE_BLOCK_NUMBER` allows you to select several code blocks to send back to your editor at once. The parameter can be set as follows:
  - `1` - Selects the first code block
  - `1,3,5` - Selects code blocks 1, 3, and 5.
  - `2..5`- Selects an inclusive range of code blocks between 2 and 5.
  - None - Selects the last provided code block.
```

<!-- command-help end -->

### Backends

The following model backends are supported:

- [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com) (Or any compatible proxy/API)
- [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)

### Editors

The following editors are currently supported. The `clipboard` editor is a special case where any copy or accept commands
are simply copied to your clipboard. This is the default behaviour. Hit any of the links below for more details on how
to use!

- Clipboard (Default)
- None (Disables all editor functionality)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/dustinblackman/oatmeal.nvim)

### Themes

A handful of themes are embedded in the application for code syntax highlighting, defaulting to [OneDark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui). If none suits your needs, Oatmeal supports any Sublime Text/Text Mate
`.tmTheme` file, which can be configured through the `--theme-file` command line parameter, or the `OATMEAL_THEME_FILE`
environment variable. [base16-textmate](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-textmate) has plenty to pick from!

### Sessions

Oatmeal persists all chat sessions with your models, allowing you to go back and review an old conversation, or pick up
from where you left off!

<!-- command-help-sessions start -->

  -h, --help                         Print help
```

<!-- command-help-sessions end -->

Grepping through previous sessions isn't something built in to Oatmeal _(yet)_. This bash function can get you there
nicely using [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

```bash
function oatmeal-sessions() {
    (
        cd "$(oatmeal sessions dir)"
        id=$(rg --color always -n . | fzf --ansi | awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | head -n1 | awk -F '.' '{print $1}')
        oatmeal sessions open --id "$id"
    )
}
```

Or something a little more in depth (while hacky) that additionally uses [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) and [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq).

```bash
function oatmeal-sessions() {
    (
        cd "$(oatmeal sessions dir)"
        id=$(
          ls | \
          (while read f; do echo "$(cat $f)\n---\n"; done;) | \
          yq -p=yaml -o=json - 2> /dev/null | \
          jq -s . | \
          jq -rc '. |= sort_by(.timestamp) | .[] |  "\(.id):\(.timestamp):\(.state.backend_model):\(.state.editor_language):\(.state.messages[] | .text | tojson)"' | \
          fzf --ansi | \
          awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | \
          head -n1 | \
          awk -F '.' '{print $1}'
        )
        oatmeal sessions open --id "$id"
    )
}
```

## Contributing

### Report an issue

On each Oatmeal release there is a separate download to helps in reporting issues to really drill down in to what the
problem is! If you've run in to a problem, I'd really help appreciate solving it.

1. Head over to [releases](https://github.com/dustinblackman/oatmeal/releases) and download the DEBUG package for the
   latest release of Oatmeal.
2. Extract the contents of the archive, and `cd` in your terminal inside the archive.
3. Run your command with the arguments provided in the error message prefixing with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./oatmeal **ARGS-HERE**`
4. Copy/paste the output and [open an issue](https://github.com/dustinblackman/oatmeal/issues/new).

### Development

#### Setup

The following will get you set up with all the necessary tooling to work on Oatmeal.

```sh
cargo install cargo-run-bin
git clone https://github.com/dustinblackman/oatmeal.git
cd oatmeal
cargo cmd setup
```

#### Adding a backend

Each backend implements the [Backend trait](./src/domain/models/backend.rs) in its own infrastructure file. The trait has documentation on what is expected of each method. You can checkout [Ollama](./src/infrastructure/backends/ollama.rs) as an example.

The following steps should be completed to add a backend:

1. Implement trait for new backend.
2. Update the [BackendName](./src/domain/models/backend.rs) enum with your new Backend name.
3. Update the [BackendManager](./src/infrastructure/backends/mod.rs) to provide your new backend.
4. Write tests

#### Adding an editor

Each editor implements the [Editor trait](./src/domain/models/editor.rs) in its own infrastructure file. The trait has documentation on what is expected of each method. You can checkout [Neovim](./src/infrastructure/editors/neovim.rs) as an example.

The following steps should be completed to add an editor:

1. Implement trait for new editor.
2. Update the [EditorName](./src/domain/models/editor.rs) enum with your new Editor name.
3. Update the [EditorManager](./src/infrastructure/editors/mod.rs) to provide your new editor.
4. Write tests

#### Adding syntax highlighting for a language

Syntax highlighting language selection is a tad manual where several languages must be curated and then added to
[`build.rs`](./build.rs).

1. Google to find a `.sublime-syntax` project on Github for your language. [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/tree/master/assets/syntaxes/02_Extra) has many!
2. Update the `get_syntaxes()` function in [`build.rs`](./build.rs) to include the new repo. Make sure to set the URL to
   a commit locked `.tar.gz` file, and to include the license in the files vector.
3. `rm -rf .caches && cargo build`
4. Test to see highlighting works.

### Why Oatmeal?

I was eating a bowl of oatmeal when I wrote the first commit :shrug:. (They don't let me name things at work anymore...)
